Molly Sans is a sans-serif family, drawn and created by Måns Grebäck between 2016 and 2019. 

With an appearance similar to traditional sign painting, this all-caps typeface works great 
in classic, genuine and crafty designs. 

Stable and perfect for stacked type settings, Molly Sans is used for headers and titles 
meant to grab the attention of the observer. 

The font family includes 25 (!) styles, from Extra-Condensed Thin to Extra-Expanded Black. 
The many style options allows for very high flexibility and real customization. 

XC = Extra-Condensed
C = Condensed
N = Normal
E = Expanded
XE = Extra-Expanded

Each style goes well with the other styles, or contrasts nicely with any script typeface.

all European, Latin-based languages.
